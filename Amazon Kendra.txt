Amazon Kendra 
=============
******************Connector Overview*******************


==>Amazon Kendra is an Intelligent search/Enterprice Search.


Kendra console=====>Connector====>DataSource



                      SDK(Connect through end-Point URL)  /cond                SpringBoot
Kendra console==============================================>Connector=================>DataSource


==>SDK is a Rest end-point, SDK is going to connect the Connector and going to share the all information.

Kendra console
Connector     ===========>SDK is a Rest end-point
DataSource

==>Amazon Kendra Index having DataSource.

==>Connector intermediate between Kendra and DataSource. here Connector connecting to DataSource and searching information sending to Kendra.

==> Code should be deployed into EC to BOX

==>Full CRAWL and Change_log

==>SDK is a Rest end-point, SDK is going to connect the Connector and going to share the all information.

fieldMapping 
============
crawlType : "Full_CRAWL"

fieldMapping is nothing but filter.


fieldMapping is nothing but filter the File/filter the PDF File like that.

==>Kendra going to call our Connector,In the connector endpoint would be configured in SDK and by using end-point(/configure) SDK call to SpringBoot App then 
   based on requirement interact with DataSource.


DataSource Synching two faces
==============================

1 startSync:: Scrolling meaning connect to DataSource featch the all information putting into the queue.
2 injection:: SDK 1 item at a time from the queue send to the Kendra for injection.


Why using index field?
=======================

Basically i could have to run on local,i cann't expect request comming from Kendra Console,

connector expect request from Kendra Console so that reason we used index field.

FieldMapping talk about CRWAL:==>Full CRAWL and Change_log
=============================
type.txt file want to inclussion and don't want to exclusion.


Once start (WorkedUp/FileSystem Connector)the SpringBoot Application,It is running or not then we should go for getConnector();

1 index haing multipule DataSource ID.

RepositoryId is nothing but DataSource ID 

fieldMappings is nothing but filter the data

Full CRAWL and Change_log
==========================

FULL_CRAWL featch the all document at a time and inject Kendra.


Once complete the FULL CRAWL then based on timestamp, it will run the Change Log ,this is the incremental mode. (Using timestamp)

“InclusionPattern“ :[.txt] inject only text file
“exclusionPattern” :[.pdf] except pdf file, inject remaining all format



2 Discussion on How to run connector
====================================

  ==>Once we must build then we can run the Connector.

  ==>Kendra console (SDK) call to API configure (end point) 

  INDEX:
  =====
  ==>1 index haing multipule DataSource ID

  DataSource ID
  =============

  ==>RepositoryId is nothing but DataSource ID 

  ==>copy the DS id and Role then we can use post man


  index field
  ===========

  Basically, i could have to run on local, I can’t expect request coming from Kendra Console,
  connecter expect request from Kendra Console.

  Field Mapping
  =============

  ==>Field Mapping talk about CRWAL:

  ==>File want to inclusion and don't want to exclusion.


  fieldMappings is nothing but filter the data 

  Full CRAWL and Change_log
  -------------------------
  FULL_CRAWL featch the all document at a time and inject Kendra.


   Once complete the FULL CRAWL then based on timestamp, it will run the Change Log ,this is the incremental mode. (Using timestamp)

   “InclusionPattern“ :[.txt] inject only text file
   “exclusionPattern” :[.pdf] except pdf file, inject remaining all format

3 Kendra Connector code quick walk through
==========================================



====================================================================================

if issue came particuler Connector,I don't know the Index,DataSource,Role and auth token etc

DataSource?




=====================

File System Connector we can used for Code commit Repository
